# ![Blogr Landing Challenge](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/juanbravozu/FrontendMentor/1a6b91f68128f7bee741556b2b3185e5e8a77c4a/Blogr-landing-challenge-master/images/logo.svg)

For this challenge I had to code the frontend for a landing page, which design was provided by FrontendMentor. 

## Challenges

- The page had to be fully responsive, so I tried for the first time a mobile-first approach.
- The navigation menu on the page had dropdowns and hover states which were pretty fun and interesting to do.

## Tech used

- HTML, SCSS and vanilla JS.
- Deployed on Netlify
